        <li class="numbers">Over the last few decades, the microwave has become a common kitchen fixture. The microwave is often praised for its convenience and ease of use. In this assignment, I set out to investigate how users across the spectrum of microwave engagement really feel about this device.

          <p>          A microwave (pictured below) is an electric oven that is used to cook and/or heat up food and beverages. It does this very quickly and users need only press a few buttons to get it working, so it makes for a rather convenient alternative to the stove top and the oven.

<!-- Part 2 -->
    <div class="page" id="part2data"><h2>PART 2: RECORDING OBSERVATIONS</h2>
      <p>I interviewed three users regarding their engagements with a home microwave.</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Agnes is an older citizen. Although it is not new technology, Agnes has not used the microwave before today because she has read several articles about the harmful effects of microwaves and radiation. </li>
        <li>Eddie is also a Brown student. He only uses the microwave to heat up beverages and leftovers every now and then. He prefers to use the stove and the oven to heat up his food.</li>
        <li>Karly is a Brown student. She is currently in a very time-consuming Computer Science class so she does not have much time to prepare meals. She has taken to microwaveable dinners and hot pockets for their convenience. She uses the microwave at least once everyday.</li>
      </ul>
      <h2 class="subheadings">Observations:</h2>
      <p>One user hit the ‘start’ button before setting a specific heating time/setting and scoffed when nothing happened. All users had to perform some form of ‘temperature test’ after removing their food/beverage from the microwave to ensure that it was hot enough. This included placing a finger on the surface of the food/beverage, or cupping its container to check for heat absorption. 2 out of 3 users engaged with the keypad to set heating time manually. Only one user engaged with the food presets (e.g ‘pizza’ and ‘beverage’ buttons). Two users expressed verbal frustration at the cleaning process and at the number of buttons that they do not use regularly and find counterintuitive (e.g the ‘clock’ button). All users wandered off intermittently while their food ws in the microwave.</p>
      <h2 class="subheadings">Questions:</h2>
      <ol>
        <li>
          <h3><u>What is your first impression of this microwave?</u> </h3>
          <p>All of the users felt that the microwave looked ‘clunky’. Eddie and Karly felt that it looked larger than it needed to be. 
            Agnes said that the buttons with food and beverage were useful, but she was not sure of the order in which she would need to press the buttons. 
          </p><p>Eddie and Karly felt that the microwave door was not as visible as it could have been as it does not have a handle. Karly pointed out that the design is not accessible to visually impaired users who may not be able to read the buttons or find the door with ease.</p>
        </li>
        <li><h3><u>What do you use the microwave for?</u> </h3>
        <p>Karly and Eddie use it to cook quick-cook meals like oatmeal, and reheat leftovers and beverages. They both use it when they are in too much of a hurry to use the stove or oven to cook, but Karly uses it a lot because she does not know how to cook many meals. Agnes usually uses her microwave for kitchen storage. Until today, she had never used it to heat up food.</p></li>
        <li>
          <h3><u>Microwaves have a user-friendly interface? (5 point scale)</u> </h3>
          <p>Karly selected ‘agree’, but Eddie selected ‘neutral’ and Agnes selected ‘disagree’. 
          </p>
        </li>
        <li> 
        <h3><u>Microwaves are my first choice for reheating food/beverages (5 point scale)</u> </h3>
        <p>Karly selected ‘agree’, while Eddie selected ‘disagree’ and Agnes selected ‘strongly disagree’. 
        </p>
      </li>
      <li><h3> <u>What are the pain points?</u> </h3>
      <p>All users complained that certain buttons provide functionality that is easier to understand/engage with than others do. For example, Agnes did not understand how exactly the ‘defrost’ button works, and had to keep interrupting the process to check whether is was working for her food.  Eddie recalled having difficulty understanding how the ‘clock’ button worked for a long time. Karly felt that there were too many “counterintuitive” buttons, so she resorts to manually reheating her food by keying in a time that she believes will get the job done, and checking on her food intermittently.</p>
       <p>All of the users complained about the sound that the microwave makes while in use. Karly and Eddie found the cleaning process laborious, and Agnes does not like that ‘radiation’ is used to heat her food. She also read an article that stated that microwaves do not kill bacteria in food as effectively as stoves and ovens can. She also complained that the microwave made some parts of her food dry and other parts soggy. All users complained that the microwave did not distribute heat evenly across their food.</p></li>
      <li><h3><u>What do you wish you could do with this device?</u> </h3>
      <p>All users wished that the microwave would distribute heat evenly across their food. Eddie and Karly wished that they did not have to clean the device manually, and that it was self-cleaning. They cited that this would be especially advantageous in settings where many people use the microwave and not everyone cleans it after making a mess in it.</p> <p>Agnes said that she did not like how the microwave changed the texture of her roast, so she wishes that the microwave could preserve the texture of the food that it heats/defrosts for extended periods of time. She also wishes that she could put metal  (specifically aluminium) in the microwave because she stores a lot of her food in aluminium foil.</p> <p>On a different and more imaginative note, Eddie wishes that he could use the microwave to rapidly cool food and beverages instead of just using it to heat them up. He felt that the microwave should be capable of more tasks, and he expressed interest in being able to change the frequency of the waves (microwaves) used in a microwave.</p></li>

        <p>Stressed-out Stella is a grandmother who is using the microwave to defrost dinner for her grandkids. She does not use the microwave often and is frustrated by the buttons and the defrost functionality. Stella represents the users that do not use the microwave often and find some of its buttons counterintuitive.</p>

        <p>Multi-tasking Martha is a student with a lot of homework and very little time to make meals for herself. She is grateful for the convenience of the microwave but has to open its door multiple times to check that her food has not made a mess in the microwave. Martha represents my interviews users because as a bust student, she has a lot of the same motivations; convenience, quickness and the ability to multi-task while preparing meals.</p>
